Business Objective: The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house 
values using the provided dataset.  
• Approach: The dataset is from Kaggle. The approach for predicting the new houses involves cleaning, 
pre-processing the data and using the appropriate machine learning algorithms for training and validating 
the model, testing the model or evaluating the model performance. The best model reaches the R-square 
value of 0.16  
• Tools and Technique Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Machine Learning Technique and Regression models
